# üöÄ Emotion Recognization and Analysis üé≠

Welcome to the **Emotion Recognization and Analysis** repository! This project focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and facial emotion recognition to analyze emotions from text or video inputs. 

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Ever wondered how to analyze emotions from written text or real-time video? This Emotion Detection Web App has got you covered! The app offers text-based emotion prediction with probability visualization and even includes a feedback form for user interaction. Additionally, real-time webcam emotion detection is included (currently disabled due to compatibility issues).

## Features ‚ú®

- **Text-based Emotion Prediction:** Provides emotion prediction from written text along with a visualization of the probabilities for each emotion.
  
- **Webcam Emotion Detection:** Utilizes facial recognition technology to analyze real-time emotions from webcam input.
  
- **Feedback Form:** Allows users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the emotion predictions.
  
## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes algorithms such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors Classification, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for emotion analysis.
  
- **NLP:** Implements Natural Language Processing techniques for text-based emotion recognition.
  
- **OpenCV:** Utilized for face detection and facial emotion recognition in the webcam module.
  
- **Streamlit:** Powers the web application interface for easy user interaction.
  
- **Python3:** Programming language used for the development of this project.
  
- **Speech Recognition:** Incorporates speech recognition for analyzing emotions from spoken words.
